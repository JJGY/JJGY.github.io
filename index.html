      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Dynamic data scientist with nearly 20 years of international experience, specialized in environment, rural development, and climate change. My career spans the United Nations (UNEP, UNODC) and German academia, where I focus on climate change mitigation, impact assessment, and the application of advanced data analytics to sustainable development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have overseen multi-million-dollar initiatives, led cross-functional teams, and delivered data-driven insights that inform global policy and programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I develop predictive models, design AI-driven tools, and build intelligent systems—from scalable reporting pipelines to LLM-powered agents—that extract meaning from complex datasets. My work enables organizations to automate analysis, enhance decision-making, and apply cutting-edge data science to real-world sustainability challenges.

        <h4>Time Series Prediction of Outbreak of Infectious Diseases</h4>
        <img src="images/project1-image.jpg" alt="Time series model visualization" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <p>This project explores the use of time series and deep learning models—specifically SMA, ARMA, RNN, and LSTM—to predict the outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 using digital stream data, such as Google search trends. Traditional disease surveillance systems often fail to deliver timely warnings, so this work aims to enhance early detection capabilities. Using data from states like New York and California, models were trained and validated to forecast COVID-19 cases.</p>

        <img src="images/project2-image.jpg" alt="Education impact analysis chart" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; margin: 10px 0;">
        <p>This project examines the impact of COVID-19 on global primary education completion rates using regression models such as Linear, Lasso, k-NN, and Adaboost. Using UNESCO and World Bank data, it estimates 2020 outcomes without the pandemic and compares them to actual values. Adaboost showed the highest accuracy (R² = 0.81), with predictions differing by less than 1%. Variables for geography and development status helped account for contextual factors. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers to assess educational resilience and better target future interventions in times of crisis.</p>

        <h4>UN World Drug Report 2020: In Focus – Alternative Development</h4>
        <img src="reports/unodc-report.jpg" alt="UNODC Report Cover">
        <p>The UN World Drug Report spotlights "Alternative Development" as a long-term, development-focused strategy to address the root causes of illicit crop cultivation—primarily poverty, lack of infrastructure, and weak governance. Rather than relying solely on eradication, alternative development aims to create sustainable livelihoods for communities vulnerable to growing crops like opium poppy and coca. Drawing on data from 53 projects across Afghanistan, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Myanmar (2013–2017), the report highlights both successes and challenges. While many interventions showed promise—especially those supporting women's income, land titling, and high-value crop alternatives—impact assessments revealed that short-term gains can quickly reverse if structural issues remain unresolved. The report underscores that sustainable results require multi-year investment, rigorous monitoring, and context-sensitive approaches. Despite a gradual increase in project funding, particularly in Colombia following the FARC peace agreement, emerging areas of illicit cultivation and gaps in household-level data remain critical blind spots. </p>

        <h4>Strategic Maps for Decision-Making on Opium Poppy Cultivation in Afghanistan</h4>
        <img src="reports/strategic-map.jpg" alt="Strategic Map">
        <p>This research explores the geographic, socioeconomic, and market-driven factors that statistically influence opium poppy cultivation across Afghanistan's districts, where over 80% of global cultivation occured. Using spatial econometric models, the study finds that cultivation is significantly more likely in districts with limited accessibility, large rural populations, availability of "advanced money" (pre-financing from traffickers), prior cultivation history, and warmer nighttime temperatures. Surprisingly, common assumptions—such as the influence of security conditions, poverty levels, or farm-gate opium prices—were not statistically significant. The model, focused on 2017 data to predict 2018 outcomes, achieved 86% accuracy but may have been impacted by that year’s severe drought. These findings highlight the complexity and regional specificity of illicit crop cultivation and underscore the need for tailored, evidence-based policy interventions. </p>

        <h4>Analysis of Remote Sensing Imagery: Identifying Opium Poppy</h4>
        <img src="reports/remote-sensing.jpg" alt="Remote Sensing">
        <p>This project explores the feasibility of identifying opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan using medium-resolution satellite imagery (Landsat 8), as high-resolution images are often unavailable. Opium poppy plots are typically very small—often smaller than a single Landsat pixel—and share similar NDVI values with other crops like wheat, making detection difficult. Additional challenges include varying crop calendars due to elevation, inconsistent climate conditions, and mixed pixels from intercropping. </p>

        <h4>Analysis of Political Speeches Using NLP: Case Study of the United Nations Biodiversity Conference</h4>
        <img src="reports/nlp-biodiversity.jpg" alt="NLP Biodiversity">
        <p>This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to analyze over 5,000 pages of speeches and decisions from the 2024 UN Biodiversity Conference and past conferences dating back to 1994. In response to the global biodiversity crisis, where up to one million species face extinction, this analysis aims to identify key themes, regional discourse differences, and evolving trends in international biodiversity policy. Three core topics emerged from the 2024 statements: biosafety and benefit-sharing, biodiversity as a national commitment, and inclusive development with indigenous rights. The analysis found regional variation, with African nations emphasizing inclusivity and biosafety more than Western countries. Over the 30-year span, these findings underscore NLP's potential to track policy evolution at scale and inform more balanced, data-driven biodiversity strategies moving forward.</p>
